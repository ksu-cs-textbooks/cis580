    <title>Elastic Collisions :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/06-physics/04-elastic-collisions/index.html</link>
    <description>Now that we’ve looked at movement derived from both linear and angular dynamics, let’s revisit them from the perspective of collisions. If we have two rigid bodies that collide, what should be the outcome? Consider an elastic collision (one in which the two objects “bounce off” one another). From Newtonian mechanics we know that:&#xA;Energy must be conserved Momentum must be conserved Thus, if we consider our two objects in isolation (as a system of two), the total system must have the same energy and momentum after the collision that it had before (Note we are talking about perfectly elastic collisions here - in the real world some energy would be converted to heat and sound).</description>
