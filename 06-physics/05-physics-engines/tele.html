<p>If we want to incorporate more robust and realistic physics than that we have just explored, we would be well-served to look at <em>physics engines</em> designed for use in games.  These are simulations built along the same lines as what we&rsquo;ve discussed - essentially they represent the objects in the game world as rigid bodies, and provide the means for simulating them somewhat realistically.</p>
