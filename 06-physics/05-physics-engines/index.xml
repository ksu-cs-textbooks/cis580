    <title>Physics Engines :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>

    <description>If we want to incorporate more robust and realistic physics than that we have just explored, we would be well-served to look at physics engines designed for use in games. These are simulations built along the same lines as what weâ€™ve discussed - essentially they represent the objects in the game world as rigid bodies, and provide the means for simulating them somewhat realistically.&#xA;Farseer / Velcro Physics One of the best-known of the physics engines developed for XNA was the Farseer Physics Engine, which was renamed to Velcro Physics when it was moved from CodePlex to GitHub.</description>
