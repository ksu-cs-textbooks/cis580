    <title>Adding the Remaining Layers :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/c-parallax-scrolling/07-add-the-remaining-layers/</link>
    <description>Now let’s turn our attention to our remaining layers. The process will be almost identical to our background, with one important difference. We’ll use two textures for the midground, and four for the background&#xA;The reason for this is we want each successive layer to be larger than the one behind it. Remember, the background will move very little relative to the players position, while the midground, which is closer to the player, will need to scroll more.</description>
