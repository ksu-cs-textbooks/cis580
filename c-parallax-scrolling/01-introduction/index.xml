    <description>Parallax scrolling is a technique that simulates depth by scrolling background layers at different speeds. This mimics the perceptions we have of distant objects moving more slowly than nearby ones.&#xA;Think of the last time you drove down a highway - how quickly did you pass fenceposts along the road? How about houses set some distance from the road? Mountains or other landmarks in the far distance? The closest objects appear to fly by, while the most distant objects hardly seem to move.</description>
