    <title>Conclusion :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/c-parallax-scrolling/09-conclusion/</link>
    <description>You now have developed a parallax scrolling game component that allows you to create multiple parallax layers, and customize how those layers scroll. Think of other ways you can scroll your layers. What if you wanted to scroll both vertically and horizontally? What if you wanted to rotate the world? You can implement these ideas with a new custom class implementing IScrollController.&#xA;You have also learned the basic techniques behind Big Bitmap game engines.</description>
