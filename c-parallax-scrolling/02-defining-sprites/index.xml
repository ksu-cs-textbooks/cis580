    <description>At its most basic, a parallax layer consists of a transformation which shifts images in the layer to the correct position.&#xA;There are several ways we could structure this. We could have a single transformation and image per layer, or we could share the same transformation amongst multiple images or even game objects. The latter has the benefit of a lot of flexibility with very little overhead, so letâ€™s adopt that approach here.</description>
