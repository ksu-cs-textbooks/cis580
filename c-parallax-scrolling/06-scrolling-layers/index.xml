    <title>Scrolling Layers :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/c-parallax-scrolling/06-scrolling-layers/</link>
    <description>Parallax scrolling is almost always tied to player movement - as the player moves, the layer scrolls in relation to the playerâ€™s position. But we could also tie the scrolling to a timer function - and have it scroll at a set speed. Or we could apply it to a secondary target - something like a drone the player might launch. We might also use the scrolling effect with no player, maybe as some kind of level preview, or for a cutscene.</description>
