    <description>Text in videogames is challenging. In the early days of computing, video cards had a limited number of modes - the most common was for displaying text that was streamed to the video card as ASCII character data. This is also how the command prompt and terminals work - they operate on streams of character data.&#xA;But games used different modes that used the limited memory of the card to supply pixel data in a variety of formats.</description>
