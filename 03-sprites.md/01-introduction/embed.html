<p>The term &ldquo;sprite&rdquo; refers to a graphical element within a two-dimensional game that moves around the screen - often representing a character, powerup, or other actor.  The term likely was coined in relation to its older definition - a small fairy creature.</p>
<p>Traditionally, sprites are a part of two-dimensional games, and are a <em>raster</em> graphic (one composed of a regular grid of pixels, aka a bitmap).  As the sprites are simply an array of bits representing pixels, and the scene being presented on screen is <em>also</em> just an array of bits representing pixels, we can place a sprite on-screen by simply copying its bits into the right location.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-sprites">Hardware Sprites</h2>
<p>The earliest implementations of sprites did this by substituting the sprite bits for background image bits <em>as the bits were streamed to the screen</em> as part of an analog frame signal.  This was done by specialized hardware that supported a limited number of sprites (hence the name <em>hardware sprites</em>).</p>
<h2 id="bit-blitting">Bit Blitting</h2>
<p>Later games used <em>bit blitting</em> (an abbreviation for bit-boundary block transfer), a technique for copying a smaller bit array into a larger one.  Early graphics hardware implemented bit blitting as a hardware instruction, meaning it could be performed very fast, provided the sprite was drawn to scale.</p>
<h2 id="textured-quads">Textured Quads</h2>
<p>Modern games (and MonoGame) often use the 3D hardware to render sprites, which means they are represented as <em>textured quads</em>.  A textured quad is essentially a rectangle composed of two triangles that always faces the screen.</p>
<p>While it is more complex than traditional sprites, there are several benefits to this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is far easier to scale sprites composed as textured quads than bit-blitted sprites (and scaling is impossible with most hardware sprites)</li>
<li>Textured Quad sprites can be rotated to an arbitrary angle using the graphics hardware.  Bit-blitted sprites could only be flipped (mirrored) in the X or Y direction, true rotations required additional sprite images drawn from the desired angle</li>
<li>Textured Quad sprites can take advantage of the Z-buffer to do depth sorting.  Traditional bit-blitted sprites had to be drawn using the <em>painters algorithm</em> or similar techniques to ensure proper layering.</li>
<li>Textured sprites are rendered using <em>shader</em> programs on the graphics card, so many unique effects can be applied to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll examine how the MonoGame implementation of textured quads works.</p>
