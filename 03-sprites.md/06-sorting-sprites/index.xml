    <title>Sorting Sprites :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/03-sprites.md/06-sorting-sprites/</link>
    <description>When drawing sprites, we often refer to the Painterâ€™s Algorithm. This algorithm simply involves drawing the most distant part of the scene first (i.e. background elements) before drawing the closer elements. This way the closer elements are drawn on top of the elements behind them, as when we draw we are literally copying over the existing pixel color values.&#xA;This is even more important when working with translucent (partially transparent) sprites, as we mix the translucent color with the color(s) of the elements underneath the translucent sprite.</description>
