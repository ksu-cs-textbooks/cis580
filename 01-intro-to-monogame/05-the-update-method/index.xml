    <description>As we mentioned before, the virtual Game.Update(GameTime gameTime) method is a hook for adding your gameâ€™s logic. By overriding this method, and adding your own game logic code, you fulfill the update step of the game loop.&#xA;This is where you place the simulation code for your game - where the world the game is representing is updated. Here, all your actors (the parts of the game world that move and interact) are updated.</description>
