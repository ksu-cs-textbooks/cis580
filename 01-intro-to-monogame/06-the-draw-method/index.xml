    <title>The Draw Method :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/01-intro-to-monogame/06-the-draw-method/index.html</link>
    <description>The Game.Draw(Game.Update(GameTime gameTime) method is a another hook, this one for adding your gameâ€™s rendering code. By overriding this method, and adding your own rendering code, you fulfill the draw step of the game loop.&#xA;MonoGame uses the graphics hardware to render the scene, along with double buffering. Thus, when we render, we are drawing into a back buffer, and once that drawing is complete, we flip the buffers so that the one we just finished is what ends up being rendered on-screen, and we now can start drawing into the next back buffer.</description>
