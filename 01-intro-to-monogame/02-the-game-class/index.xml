    <description>At the heart of an XNA project is a class that inherits from Game. This class handles initializing the graphics device, manages components, and most importantly, implements the game loop.&#xA;The MonoGame Game Loop As you saw in the Game Loop Chapter of Game Programming Patterns:&#xA;A game loop runs continuously during gameplay. Each turn of the loop, it processes user input without blocking, updates the game state, and renders the game.</description>
