    <title>Positional Sounds :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/05-audio/03-positional-sounds/</link>
    <description>Positional sounds provide the illusion of depth and movement by using panning, doppler shift, and other techniques to emulate the affect movement and distance have on sounds. Positional sounds can convey important information in games, especially when combined with surround-sound speakers and headphones.&#xA;To create positional sound effects, we need to place the sound in a 3D (or pseudo 2D) soundscape, which incorporates both a listener (i.e. the player) and an emitter (the source of the sound).</description>
