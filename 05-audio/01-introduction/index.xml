    <description>We often focus on the visual aspects of games, but the audio aspects can really make a game shine. Consider that many game tracks are now presented as orchestral performances:&#xA;And how important sound effects can be for conveying what is happening in a game?&#xA;In this chapter, we will explore both sound effects and music, and how to implement them within MonoGame.</description>
