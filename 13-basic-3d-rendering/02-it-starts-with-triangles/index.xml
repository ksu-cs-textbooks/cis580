    <title>It Starts with Triangles :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>

    <description>You probably remember from our discussions of matrix math that we can create matrices to represent arbitrary transformations. Moreover, we can transform a vector by multiplying it by one of these transformation matrices. This is the mathematical foundations of hardware-accelerated 3D rendering. In fact, the GPU is nothing more than a processor optimized for performing matrix and vector operations.&#xA;We model our three-dimensional worlds with triangles. Lots and lots of triangles.</description>
