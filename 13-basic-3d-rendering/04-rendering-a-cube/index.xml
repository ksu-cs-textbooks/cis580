    <title>Rendering a Cube :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/13-basic-3d-rendering/04-rendering-a-cube/</link>
    <description>We’ll continue our exploration of the rendering pipeline with another shape - a cube. And as before, we’ll introduce another concept - vertex and index buffers.&#xA;For our triangle and quad, we drew our shapes using GraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitives&lt;T&gt;() and GraphicsDevice.DrawUserIndexedPrimitives&lt;T&gt;(). Our vertices and indices were simply arrays we declared normally, that we passed to the graphics card using the aforementioned methods. As with most variables we deal with in C#, the memory used by the vertices and indices arrays was allocated from the computer’s RAM.</description>
