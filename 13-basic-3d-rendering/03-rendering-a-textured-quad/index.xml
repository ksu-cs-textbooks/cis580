    <title>Rendering a Textured Quad :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/13-basic-3d-rendering/03-rendering-a-textured-quad/</link>
    <description>While the point of a TriangleStrip is to optimize by reducing the number of vertices, in most cases it still will have repeats, and it is difficult to define a complex mesh out of a single strip. Thus, in addition to vertices, we can provide indices to specific vertices. The collection of indices contains nothing more than integers referencing vertices in the vertices collection. This means each unique vertex needs to be defined exactly once, and the indices take on the role of defining the triangles by giving the position of each successive vertex in the triangle list in the vertex array.</description>
