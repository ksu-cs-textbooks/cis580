    <title>Summary :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/13-basic-3d-rendering/05-summary/</link>
    <description>This wraps up our discussion of the basics of 3D rendering. As you might expect, this is just the basic foundations. From here weâ€™ll explore using models, creating lighting effect, animations, and more. But all of these will depend on understanding and using these basic elements, so get comfortable with them!</description>
