    <description>The term “3D rendering” refers to converting a three-dimensional representation of a scene into a two-dimensional frame. While there are multiple ways to represent and render three-dimensional scenes (ray-tracing, voxels, etc.), games are dominated by a standardized technique supported by graphics card hardware. This approach is so ubiquitous that when we talk about 3D rendering in games, this is the approach we are typically referring to.&#xA;Remember that games are “real-time”, which means they must present a new frame every 1/30th of a second to create the illusion of motion.</description>
