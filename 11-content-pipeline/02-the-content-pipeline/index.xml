    <description>As we described in the introduction, the XNA Content Pipelineâ€™s purpose is to transform asset files (content) in to a form most readily useable by our games. It is implemented as a separate build step that is run every time we compile our game. In fact, each XNA game is actually two projects - the Content project, and the Game project.&#xA;The pipeline is broken up into several steps:&#xA;Importing the asset data Processing the asset data Serializing the asset data Loading the serialized asset data You can see the process here:</description>
