    <description>The creation of assets (textures, audio, models, etc) is a major aspect of game development. In fact, asset creators account for most of a game development team (often a 90/10 split between asset creators and programmers). So creating and using assets is a very important part of creating games!&#xA;To make this process manageable, most assets are created with other software tools - editors specific to the kind of asset we are dealing with.</description>
