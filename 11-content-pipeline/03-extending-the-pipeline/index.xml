    <title>Extending the Pipeline :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/11-content-pipeline/03-extending-the-pipeline/</link>
    <description>You might be wondering why the content pipeline in XNA was created this way - with importers, processors, content writers, and content readers. The answer is simple - modularity. If you want to load a new image format that the TextureImporter does not handle, you can write your own custom importer to load its data into a TextureContent object, and then still use the existing TextureProcessor and serialization process.&#xA;Alternatively, you may want to handle a new content type that has no associated classes in XNA at all.</description>
