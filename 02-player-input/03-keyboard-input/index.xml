    <title>Keyboard Input :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/02-player-input/03-keyboard-input/</link>
    <description>Let’s start with the keyboard. MonoGame uses the KeyboardState struct to represent the state of a keyboard. It is essentially a wrapper around an array of bits - one for each key in a standard keyboard. The indices of each key are represented by the Keys enumeration (you can find a complete listing in the docs).&#xA;We get the current state of the keyboard with the static Keyboard’s GetState() method, which returns the aforementioned KeyboardState struct.</description>
