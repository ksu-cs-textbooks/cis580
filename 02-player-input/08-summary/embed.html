<p>In this chapter we learned about <em>input polling</em> and how it is implemented in XNA using structures representing input state and static <code>GetState()</code> methods.  We saw the three primary forms of input we use in the MonoGame framework - the keyboard, the mouse, and the gamepad.</p>
<p>We also saw how a variety of game controllers (i.e. RockBand gear, steering wheels, flight sticks, etc.) are mapped to the standard gamepad; how its state struct is actually composed of several sub-structs; and how to turn on and off the vibration motors.</p>
<p>Finally, we discussed how we can use two copies of a state struct - one from the prior frame and one from the current frame - to determine if a button was just pressed or released.</p>
