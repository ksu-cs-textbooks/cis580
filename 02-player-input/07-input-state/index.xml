    <title>Input State :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/02-player-input/07-input-state/</link>
    <description>The Game State Management Sample provides a contrasting approach to the input manager. Instead of being tailored to a specific game, it seeks to provide generic access to all input information. It also handles multiplayer input, and can be used to manage when a player switches gamepads. A simplified form (which does not handle gestural input) is provided below.&#xA;In particular, the IsButtonPressed(Buttons button, PlayerIndex? controllingPlayer, out PlayerIndex playerIndex) can check for a key press on any connected keyboard, or identify what playerâ€™s keyboard was the source of the input.</description>
