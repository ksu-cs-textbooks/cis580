    <title>Gamepad Input :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/02-player-input/05-gamepad-input/</link>
    <description>MonoGame handles gamepad input in a similar fashion to Keyboard and Mouse input. For example, there is a static GamePad class and a GamePadState struct.&#xA;Player Indices However, XNA was originally designed to work with the XBox 360, which supported up to four players connected through XBox 360 gamepads. Thus, instead of using GamePad.GetState() we would use GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex playerIndex), where the PlayerIndex enumeration value corresponded to which playerâ€™s gamepad we wanted to poll.</description>
