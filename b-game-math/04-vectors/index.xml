    <title>Vectors :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/b-game-math/04-vectors/index.html</link>
    <description>Games almost universally use vectors to represent coordinates rather than points, as these have additional mathematical properties which can be very helpful. In mathematical notation, vectors are expressed similar to points, but use angle brackets, i.e.: $ $ and $ $ for two- and three-element vectors. A vector represents both direction and magnitude, and relates to the trigonometric right triangle. Consider the case of a two-element vector - the vector is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with adjacent leg formed by its X component and opposite leg formed by its Y component.</description>
