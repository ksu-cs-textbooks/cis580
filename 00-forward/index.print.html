<h2 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h2>
<p>This course is intended to introduce the fundamentals of creating computer game systems. Computer games are uniquely challenging in the field of software development, as they are considerably complex systems composed of many interconnected subsystems that draw upon the breadth of the field - and must operate within real-time constraints. For this semester, my goals for you as a student are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To develop a broad understanding of the algorithms and data structures often utilized within
games.</li>
<li>To recognize that there are many valid software designs, and to learn to evaluate them in terms of their appropriateness and trade-offs.</li>
<li>To expand your games portfolio with fun, engaging, and technically sophisticated games of your own devising.</li>
<li>To practice the software development and communication skills needed to participate meaningfully within our industry.</li>
<li>To develop a feel for the aesthetics of game design.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of our activities this semester will be informed by these goals.</p>

</div>
<p>A good portion of this course is devoted to learning about algorithms, data structures, and design patterns commonly used in constructing computer games.  To introduce and learn about each of these topics we have adopted the following pedagogical strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>To introduce the topic, you will read a textbook chapter or watch a recorded lecture on the theory behind the algorithm, data structure, or design pattern.</li>
<li>You will then be asked toa video tutorial to implement the approach in a sample/demo project.  When you finish, you will submit the project you have created.</li>
<li>You will then be challenged to use the approach in one (or more) original game assignments.  This requires some thought of what kind of game makes sense for the approach, and it needs to be adapted to work with that game.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to learning about the programming techniques used in games, you are also challenged to build <em>good</em> games.  This requires you to consider games from the standpoint of <em>an aesthetic experience</em>, much like any form of art or literature. Accordingly, we are borrowing some techniques from the study of creative subjects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of your readings will be focused on the aesthetics of game design.  Why do we play games?  What makes a good game?</li>
<li>For each original game you produce, a portion of the grade will be derived from the aesthetic experience it provides, i.e. is it fun?  Does it invoke emotional responses from the player?</li>
<li>You will also engage in activities focused on critiquing games - evaluating them in terms of an aesthetic experience.  What works in the game design?  What helps you engage as a player?  What doesn&rsquo;t work in the game design?  What interferes with your ability to enjoy the game?</li>
<li>You will also submit some of your original games to be &ldquo;workshopped&rdquo; by the class - critiqued by your peers as a strategy to help you evaluate your own work.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="class-meetings">Class Meetings</h2>
<p>This class is presented in a &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; format.  This means that you will need to do readings and work through tutorials <em>before</em> the class period.  Instead of lectures, class meetings are reserved for discussion, brainstorming, development, and workshops. Attendance is expected - remember class time is your opportunity to ask questions, get help, and garner feedback on your game designs. Active participation in discussions and critiques is likewise expected.</p>

<p>In the case of illness, you should not attend class in-person, but may join via Zoom by notifying me before class begins. This will allow you to participate to the best of your ability. However, this option should <em>only</em> be used for illness.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="course-modules">Course Modules</h2>
<p>The course activities have been organized into modules in Canvas which help group related materials and activities.  You should work your way through each module from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="course-readings">Course Readings</h3>
<p>Most modules will contain assigned readings and/or videos for you to study as a first step towards understanding the topic.  These are drawn from a variety of sources, and are all available on Canvas.</p>
<p>We will make heavy use of Robert Nystrom&rsquo;s <em>Game Programming Patterns</em>, an exploration of common design patterns used in video games.  It can be bought in print, but he also has a free web version: <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html" rel="external" target="_blank">https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html</a>.</p>
<h3 id="course-tutorials">Course Tutorials</h3>
<p>Most modules will also contain a tutorial exploring implementing the covered topic with the MonoGame/XNA technologies we will be using in this course.  These are organized into the course textbook (which you are reading now).  It is available in its entirety at <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/</a>.</p>
<h3 id="original-game-assignments">Original Game Assignments</h3>
<p>Every few topics you will be challenged to create an original game that draws upon the techniques you have learned about. For each game, there will be a limited number of algorithms, data structures, or approaches you are required to implement.  Each original game is worth 100 points.</p>
<p>These are graded using <em>criterion grading</em>, an approach where your assignment is evaluated according to a set criteria.  If it meets the criteria, you get full points.  If it doesn&rsquo;t, you get 0 points.  The criteria for your games are twofold.  First, you must implement the required techniques within your game.  If you do, you earn 70 points.  If you don&rsquo;t, you earn 0. For games that meet the criteria, they are further evaluated <em>as a game</em>.  If you have created a playable game that is at least somewhat fun and aesthetically pleasing, you can earn an additional 30 points.</p>
<p>I have adopted this grading system as I have found it allows for more creative freedom for students in creating their games than a detailed rubric does (which, by its very nature forces you to make a particular kind of game).  However, I do recognize that some students struggle with the lack of a clear end goal.  If this is the case for you, I suggest you speak with myself, the TAs, or the class to brainstorm ideas of what kind of game you can build to achieve the criteria.</p>
<h4 id="serial-submissions">Serial Submissions</h4>
<p>In this course, it is acceptable to submit the same game project for multiple assignments. Each time you submit your game, you will need to incorporate the new set of requirements.  This allows you to make more complex games by evolving a concept through multiple iterations.</p>
<h4 id="working-in-teams">Working in Teams</h4>
<p>You may work with other students as a team to develop no more than three of your original game submissions.  These cannot be one of the first four original game assignments.  If you choose to work as a team, you must send me a message in Ed Discussion board listing each member of the team, ideally before you start working on the game.  Students working on teams will also be required to submit a peer review evaluating the contributions of each member of the team.  This will be used to modify the game score assigned to each student.  <strong>Be aware that I will not tolerate students letting their teammates do all the work - any student who does will receive a 0 for the assignment.</strong></p>
<h2 id="workshopping">Workshopping</h2>
<p>Workshopping is an approach common to the creative arts that we are adapting to game design.  Each student will have the opportunity to workshop their games during the semester.  In addition, for your first two workshops you may and earn up to 100 extra credit points (50 points for each).</p>
<p>Workshops will be held on Wednesdays, and we can have up to four workshops per day.  Workshops are available on a first-come basis.  To reserve your slot, You must sign up by posting to the <strong>Workshops discussion board</strong> in Canvas.</p>
<p>The class should play the week&rsquo;s workshop games <em>before</em> the class meeting on Wednesday. In that class meeting we will discuss the game for ~10 minutes while the creator of the game remains a silent observer and takes notes.  After this time has elapsed, the team can ask questions of the game creator, and visa versa.  During these workshops, please use good <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/00-forward/03-workshop-etiquette/" rel="external" target="_blank">workshop etiquette</a>.</p>

<p>For many of you, workshopping represents a new kind of activity you have never engaged in. We want our workshops to be a positive learning experience, where the creator feels safe sharing their work.  Here are some guidelines to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Comments that are less than courteous and insightful have no place in a workshop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t offer empty flattery, i.e. &ldquo;I loved this game.&rdquo;  Describe <em>why</em> you loved it, and offer specific examples of its strengths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Likewise, share where the game <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> working for you. Be as tactful as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All comments should be constructive, helping the creator to strengthen their game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must address the game you were given, not the game <em>you</em> would have created if it had been your idea.  <em>Even if you think your idea is better.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to redesign the game for the creator.  That is for the creator to do - just point out areas of concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always start by describing the positive aspects of the game before you address any perceived weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid loaded judgment words like &ldquo;tacky&rdquo; or &ldquo;cliche&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never start with a disarming phrase like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be mean, but&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not to be a jerk, but&rdquo;.  These automatically put the creator on the defensive, and undermine the positive benefit of your criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the focus on the workshop.  Don&rsquo;t get diverted into what game(s) this one is similar to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like all art, games my choose to tackle subjects that may make you uncomfortable. Don&rsquo;t attack a work for this - rather, examine why you had that reaction to the game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember too, that <em>you</em> will be the creator for an upcoming workshop.  Treat the creator as you hope they will treat you!</p>

<p>As you work on the materials in this course, you may run into questions or problems and need assistance.</p>
<h2 id="class-sessions">Class Sessions</h2>
<p>A portion of each class session is set aside for questions that have come up as you&rsquo;ve worked through the course materials.  Please take advantage of this time; not only will you benefit from the answer, but so will your classmates!</p>
<h2 id="ed-discussions-forum">Ed Discussions Forum</h2>
<p>For questions that crop up outside of class times, your first line of communication for this course is the Ed Discussions forum, which can be reached through Canvas. This forum allows you to post questions which can be answered by me or your classmates, which can be searched by everyone in the class.  In addition, it allows for anonymous postings (if you feel uncomfortable letting people know who is asking), or write posts that can only be viewed by the instructor (for questions about grades, etc). The Ed Discussions forum also has good support for writing posts in markdown and writing an displaying code snippets.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 id="other-features">Other Features</h3>
<p>Ed Discussions includes lots of useful features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>@</code> symbol with a username in a message to create a mention, which notifies that user immediately, i.e. <strong>@Nathan Bean</strong> will alert me that you&rsquo;ve made a post that mentions me.</li>
<li>Use the backtick mark (, i.e. <code>`var c = 4;`</code>) to enclose code snippets to format them as programming code, and triple backtick marks to enclose multiple lines of code (<code>```[multiline code]```</code>).</li>
<li>You can also set your status to indicate your current availability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>Ed Discussions is the preferred communication medium for the course because 1) you will generally get a faster response than email, and 2) writing code in email is <em>a terrible experience</em>, both to write and to read.  Ed Discussions&rsquo;s support of markdown syntax makes including code comments much easier on both of us.</p>
<p>However, if you have issues with Ed Discussions, feel free to email one of the instructors directly if you are unable to post directly on Ed Discussions itself for some reason.</p>
<h2 id="game-development-club">Game Development Club</h2>
<p>Another great resource available to you is the Kansas State University Game Development Club.  You can learn more at the club website <a href="https://gdc.cs.ksu.edu/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://gdc.cs.ksu.edu/</a>. They also have a channel on the departmental Discord Server, <strong>#game-dev-club</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="other-avenues-for-help">Other Avenues for Help</h2>
<p>There are a few resources available to you that you should be aware of. First, if you have any issues working with K-State Canvas, K-State IT resources, or any other technology related to the delivery of the course, your first source of help is the K-State IT Helpdesk. They can easily be reached via email at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ksu.edu" rel="external" target="_blank">helpdesk@ksu.edu</a>. Beyond them, there are many online resources for using Canvas, all of which are linked in the resources section below the video. As a last resort, you may also want to post in Discord, but in most cases we may simply redirect you to the K-State helpdesk for assistance.</p>
<p>If you have issues with the technical content of the course, specifically related to completing the tutorials and projects, there are several resources available to you. First and foremost, make sure you consult the vast amount of material available in the course modules, including the links to resources. Usually, most answers you need can be found there.</p>
<p>If you are still stuck or unsure of where to go, the next best thing is to post your question on Discord, or review existing discussions for a possible answer. You can find the link to the left of this video. As discussed earlier, the instructors, TAs, and fellow students can all help answer your question quickly.</p>
<p>Of course, as another step you can always exercise your information-gathering skills and use online search tools such as Google to answer your question. While you are not allowed to search online for direct solutions to assignments or projects, you are more than welcome to use Google to access programming resources such as <a href="https://docs.monogame.net/" rel="external" target="_blank">The MonoGame Documentation</a>, the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/" rel="external" target="_blank">Microsoft Developer Network</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/" rel="external" target="_blank">C# language documentation</a>, and other tutorials. I can definitely assure you that programmers working in industry are often using Google and other online resources to solve problems, so there is no reason why you shouldn’t start building that skill now.</p>
<p>Next, we have grading and administrative issues. This could include problems or mistakes in the grade you received on a project, missing course resources, or any concerns you have regarding the course and the conduct of myself and your peers. You’ll be interacting with us on a variety of online platforms and sometimes things happen that are inappropriate or offensive. There are lots of resources at K-State to help you with those situations. First and foremost, please DM me on Ed Discussions as soon as possible and let me know about your concern, if it is appropriate for me to be involved. If not, or if you’d rather talk with someone other than me about your issue, I encourage you to contact either your academic advisor, the CS department staff, College of Engineering Student Services, or the K-State Office of Student Life. Finally, if you have any concerns that you feel should be reported to K-State, you can do so at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/report/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://www.k-state.edu/report/</a>. That site also has links to a large number of resources at K-State that you can use when you need help.</p>
<p>Finally, if you find any errors or omissions in the course content, or have suggestions for additional resources to include in the course, DM the instructors on Discord. There are some extra credit points available for helping to improve the course, so be on the lookout for anything that you feel could be changed or improved.</p>

  <div class="box-content">

<p>The <strong>Bug Bounty</strong> extra credit assignment gives points for finding errors in the course materials.  Remember, your instructors are human, and do make mistakes!  But we don&rsquo;t want those occasional mistakes to trip you and your peers up in your learning efforts, so bringing them to our attention is appreciated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, in summary, Ed Discussions should always be your first stop when you have a question or run into a problem. For issues with Canvas or Visual Studio, you are also welcome to refer directly to the resources for those platforms. For questions specifically related to the projects, use Ed Discussions for sure. For grading questions and errors in the course content or any other issues, please DM the instructors on Ed Discussions for assistance.</p>
<p>Our goal in this program is to make sure that you have the resources available to you to be successful. Please don’t be afraid to take advantage of them and ask questions whenever you want.</p>

<h2 id="monogame-and-visual-studio">MonoGame and Visual Studio</h2>
<p>For this course, we will be using a number of software packages including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2022</li>
<li>The MonoGame Framework</li>
</ul>
<p>These have been installed in the classroom lab, as well as all  Computer Science labs.  It is strongly suggested that you install the same versions on your own development machines if you plan on working from home.  Alternatively, you can <em>remote desktop</em> into a lab computer and use the installed software there.</p>
<h3 id="remote-desktop-access">Remote Desktop Access</h3>
<p>To use a remote desktop, you must first install a remote desktop client on your computer. Microsoft supplies a client for most platforms, which you can find links to and information about <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients?redirectedfrom=MSDN" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The remote desktop server is behind a network firewall, so when accessing it from off-campus, you must be using the K-State Virtual Private Network (VPN).  It has its own client that also must be installed.  You can learn about K-State&rsquo;s VPN and download the client on <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/its/security/secure-data/vpn/" rel="external" target="_blank">K-State&rsquo;s VPN Page</a></p>
<p>For remote desktop servers, you can use those maintained by <a href="https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/Remote_Access" rel="external" target="_blank">The Department of Computer Science</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installing-on-your-machine">Installing on Your Machine</h3>
<p>If you would prefer to install the software on your own development machine, you can obtain no-cost copies of Microsoft Visual Studio Professional Edition through Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools" rel="external" target="_blank">Azure Portal</a> and signing in with your K-State eid and password.</p>
<p>After signing in, click the &ldquo;Software&rdquo; option in the left menu, and browse the available software for what you need.</p>
<p>The Visual Studio Community Edition is also available as a free download <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>. While not as full-featured as the Professional edition you can download through Azure Portal, it will be sufficient for the needs of this class.</p>
<p>MonoGame can then be installed as a plugin to Visual Studio 2022, following the <a href="https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_windows.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Setting up your development environment for Windows</a>.  While it is possible to develop on Linux or macOS, all course materials will be presented for Windows, and it is recommended you use that development environment.</p>
<p>While not strictly required for the course, these additional software packages may come in very handy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bfxr.net/" rel="external" target="_blank">BFXR</a> A free online sound effect generator perfect for creating 8-bit sound effects.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Piskel</a> A free online pixel art program specifically for drawing animated sprites.</li>
<li><a href="https://graphicsgale.com/us/" rel="external" target="_blank">Graphics Gale</a> A downloadable freeware animation editor.</li>
<li><a href="https://inkscape.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> an open-source vector graphics editor you can install (and is installed in the labs).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Tiled Map Editor</a> an open-source tool for creating tile maps you can install (and is installed in the labs).</li>
</ul>
<p>A broader list of useful tools can be found <a href="https://github.com/kobitoko/Game-Jam-Tools-Resources" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>Assets are all the resources - art, sound, music - that go into a game.  While you can create entirely original assets for your games, this is not required.  However, if you choose to use assets created by other people, you <em>must follow copyright law</em>.  Specifically, you must have the right to use the asset in your project.</p>
<p>This right can be expressed in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the asset is in the public domain.  This is less common with art, but old music scores (i.e. classical music, folk music) are typically in the open domain.  Be aware that just because the score (the written form) is in the public domain, a recording of a performance may not be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assets released under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licenses.  These licenses can have different restrictions (i.e. only used for non-profit, the creator must be credited).  These must be followed for the use to be legal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assets you have written permission from the creator to use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crediting-asset-creators">Crediting Asset Creators</h2>
<p>If you use an asset that you did not create, it is a good practice to credit the creator.  This holds true even when you aren&rsquo;t required to.  A common strategy for games is to have a credits screen that lists all the contributors to the game and what their contributions were.  You may also include a text file in your repository with the assets and creator identities.</p>
<h2 id="academic-honesty-and-games">Academic Honesty and Games</h2>
<p>Because your games are also an academic work, you also need to follow the guidelines for avoiding plagiarism.  Essentially, this is claiming credit for work you did not do.  Assets can definitely fall into this category.  The guidelines here are similar to copyright - you should credit every asset creator you use. When possible, list the creator in the game&rsquo;s credits screen.</p>
<p>In addition you must provide in your repository a list of all assets you did not create. This list should be in a top-level file named <em>ASSETS.md</em>, and clearly label:</p>
<ol>
<li>The asset file name</li>
<li>The creator (if known)</li>
<li>The terms of use (i.e. public domain, license name, or other reference)</li>
</ol>

  <div class="box-content">

<p>The <em>md.</em> extension, used for your <em>README.md</em> and <em>ASSETS.md</em> indicates a markdown file.  Markdown is a markup language (i.e. text + some additional formatting). GitHub automatically converts markdown to HTML when it displays it, and markdown is also very human-readable, making it a good format for sharing information.</p>
<p>You can create a hyperlink in a markdown file with the following syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Welcome to the [Department of Computer Science at K-State](https://cs.ksu.edu)!</code></pre></div><p>Also, images can be embedded in much the same way:</p>

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>This course is intended to introduce the fundamentals of creating computer game systems. Computer
games are uniquely challenging in the field of software development, as they are considerably complex
systems composed of many interconnected subsystems that draw upon the breadth of the field - and
must operate within real-time constraints. For this semester, my goals for you as a student are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To develop a broad understanding of the algorithms and data structures often utilized within
games.</li>
<li>To recognize that there are many valid software designs, and to learn to evaluate them in terms
of their appropriateness and trade-offs.</li>
<li>To expand your games portfolio with fun, engaging, and technically sophisticated games of your
own devising.</li>
<li>To practice the software development and communication skills needed to participate
meaningfully within our industry.
All of our activities this semester will be informed by these goals.</li>

<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h3>
<p>A common axiom in learner-centered teaching is <strong><em>“(s)he who does the work does the learning.”</em></strong> What this really means is that students primarily learn through grappling with the concepts and skills of a course while attempting to apply them. Simply seeing a demonstration or hearing a lecture by itself doesn’t do much in terms of learning. This is not to say that they don’t serve an important role - as they set the stage for the learning to come, helping you to recognize the core ideas to focus on as you work. The work itself consists of applying ideas,
practicing skills, and putting the concepts into your own words.</p>
<p>This course is built around learner-centered teaching and its recognition of the role and
importance of these different aspects of learning. Most modules will consist of readings interspersed with a variety of hands-on activities built around the concepts and skills we are seeking to master. In addition, we will be applying these ideas in iteratively building a series of original video games over the semester. Part of our class time will be reserved for working on and discussing these games, giving you the chance to ask questions and receive feedback from your instructors, UTAs, and classmates.</p>
<h3 id="the-work">The Work</h3>
<p>There is no shortcut to becoming a great game programmer. Only by <strong><em>doing the work</em></strong> will you develop the skills and knowledge to make your a successful game developer. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.</p>
<h4 id="readings">Readings</h4>
<p>Each module will include assigned readings focusing on both game programming theory and concrete approaches using MonoGame.  You will need to read these to establish the theoretical and practical foundations for tackling the tutorials and original game projects.</p>
<h4 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h4>
<p>Each module will include tutorial assignments that will take you step-by-step through using a particular concept or technique.  The point is not simply to complete the tutorial, but to <em>practice</em> the technique and coding involved.  You will be expected to implement these techniques on your own in your game projects - so this practice helps prepare you for those assignments.</p>
<h4 id="original-game-programming-assignments">Original Game Programming Assignments</h4>
<p>Throughout the semester you will be building original games incorporating the techniques you have been learning; every two weeks a new game build will be due. These games can be completely new games, or build on games you turned in as a prior project, incorporating the new assigned techniques.</p>
<p>These original game projects are graded using <em>criterion grading</em>, and approach that <em>only</em> assigns points for completing the full requirements.  However, the requirements will be brief and straightforward, i.e.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a game that detects collisions between sprites and responds by altering the simulation in a significant way (i.e. changing sprite direction, removing sprites from the game, increasing or decreasing health, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Games that meet the assigned criteria will be awarded 70 points.</p>
<p>In addition, games that fulfill <em>aesthetic goals</em> of being engaging and/or eliciting emotions from the player (other than frustration) will be awarded an additional 30 points.  This is largely focused on <em>what separates a game from a technical demo</em>.  Your game doesn&rsquo;t have to be world-shattering to earn these points, just playable and somewhat fun.</p>
<p>You have the option of collaborating with other students in the class to create larger, group games for any original game project after the first four. As part of participating in a group development effort, you must complete a peer review for each of your teammates, due along with the game.  The results of the peer review will be shared with your teammates to help develop teamwork skills.  Additionally, your individual grade for the game assignment may be modified based on the peer review feedback.</p>
<h4 id="workshops">Workshops</h4>
<p>Over the course of the semester, you will have the opportunity to have your games be workshopped by your peers. This is a valuable opportunity to gain critical feedback on your work, and you can earn up to 100 extra credit points (the equivalent of one game assignment) for each game you workshop.</p>
<p>Each week you should download and play the games that will be workshopped that week and be ready to discuss the game in class.</p>
<h4 id="exams">Exams</h4>
<p>There will be no exams given in this course.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total out of the possible number of points. In this course, it is perfectly possible to get an A simply by completing all the software milestones in a satisfactory manner and attending and participating in class each day. In such a case, the examinations will simply reflect the learning you’ve been doing through that work. Each work category constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:</p>
<p>38% - Activities (The lowest score is dropped)</p>
<p>42% - Original Game Projects (7% each, 7 games total)</p>
<p>20% - Final Game</p>
<p>Extra Credit</p>
<p>14% - Workshops (7% each, 2 workshops total)</p>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:
90% - 100% - A; 80% - 89.99% - B; 70% - 79.99% - C; 60% - 69.99% - D; 00% - 59.99% - F</p>
<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<p>Collaboration is an important practice for both learning and software development. As such, you are encouraged to work with peers and seek out help from your instructors and UTAs. However, it is also critical to remember that <strong><em>(s)he who does the work, does the learning.</em></strong>  Relying too much on your peers will deny you the opportunity to learn yourself.</p>
<p>Game development is almost always a team activity, so you may choose to tackle the later game projects in a team.  Obviously, a high degree of collaboration is expected here.  Be aware that this does not mean you have the opportunity to let your team do all the work.  Students who have not contributed (based on their peer reviews) will receive a 0 on team game projects.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle warning">
  <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div>
  <div class="box-content">

<p>Read the late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructor via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Every student should strive to turn in work on time. Late work will receive a penalty of 10% of the possible points for each day it is late. If you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>We will be using Visual Studio 2019 as our development environment. You can download a free copy of Visual Studio Community for your own machine at
<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/</a>. You should also be able to get a professional

<p>Discord also offers some free desktop and mobile clients that you may prefer over the web client.  You may download them from: <a href="https://discord.com/download" rel="external" target="_blank">https://discord.com/download</a>.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-texts--supplies">Recommended Texts &amp; Supplies</h3>
<p>To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser, broadband internet connection, and webcam and microphone. All course materials will be provided via Canvas. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.</p>
<p>This course offers an instructor-written textbook, which is broken up into a specific reading order and interleaved with activities and quizzes in the modules. It can also be directly accessed at <a href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will be using Robert Nystrom&rsquo;s <em>Game Programming Patterns</em>, an exploration of common design patterns used in video games.  It can be bought in print, but he also has a free web version at <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html" rel="external" target="_blank">https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html</a></p>
<p>Students who would like additional textbooks should refer to resources available on the <a href="https://go.oreilly.com/kansas-state-university" rel="external" target="_blank">O&rsquo;Riley For Higher Education</a> digital library offered by the Kansas State University Library.  These include electronic editions of popular textbooks as well as videos and tutorials.</p>
<h3 id="subject-to-change">Subject to Change</h3>
<p>The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.</p>
<h3 id="k-state-8">K-State 8</h3>
<p>CIS 580 helps satisfy the Aesthetic Interpretation tag in the K-State 8 General Education program. As part of this course, you will both develop and critique computer games, which constitute a form of aesthetic expression that is both similar and dissimilar from literature and film.</p>
<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/honor/" rel="external" target="_blank">Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.” A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>
<p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in an automatic 0 for the assignment and the violation will be reported to the Honor System. A second violation will result in an XF in the course.</strong></p>
<p>In this course, <em>unauthorized aid</em> broadly consists of <em>giving or receiving code to complete assignments</em>.  This could be code you share with a classmate, code you have asked a third party to write for you, or code you have found online or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Authorized aid - which is not a violation of the honor policy - includes using the code snippets provided in the course materials, discussing strategies and techniques with classmates, instructors, TAs, and mentors. Additionally, you may use code snippets and algorithms found in textbooks and web sources if you clearly label them with comments indicating where the code came from and how it is being used in your project.</p>
<p>Be aware that using assets (images, sounds, etc.) that you do not have permission to use constitutes both <em>unauthorized aid</em> <strong>and</strong> copyright infringement.</p>

<p>This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from <a href="https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/" rel="external" target="_blank">this statement</a> from K-State Global Campus, and the<a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual" rel="external" target="_blank">Recurse Center Manual</a>.

<p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p>
<p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li>
<li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li>
<li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li>
<li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li>
<li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won&rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.</li>
<li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li>
<li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li>
<li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li>
<li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li>
<li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&hellip;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li>
<li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/" rel="external" target="_blank">K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p>
