    <title>Workshop Etiquette :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/00-forward/03-workshop-etiquette/</link>
    <description>Web Only This textbook was authored for the CIS 580 - Fundamentals of Game Programming course at Kansas State University. This front matter is specific to that course. If you are not enrolled in the course, please disregard this section.&#xA;For many of you, workshopping represents a new kind of activity you have never engaged in. We want our workshops to be a positive learning experience, where the creator feels safe sharing their work.</description>
