<p>For many of you, workshopping represents a new kind of activity you have never engaged in. We want our workshops to be a positive learning experience, where the creator feels safe sharing their work.  Here are some guidelines to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Comments that are less than courteous and insightful have no place in a workshop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t offer empty flattery, i.e. &ldquo;I loved this game.&rdquo;  Describe <em>why</em> you loved it, and offer specific examples of its strengths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Likewise, share where the game <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> working for you. Be as tactful as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All comments should be constructive, helping the creator to strengthen their game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must address the game you were given, not the game <em>you</em> would have created if it had been your idea.  <em>Even if you think your idea is better.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to redesign the game for the creator.  That is for the creator to do - just point out areas of concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always start by describing the positive aspects of the game before you address any perceived weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid loaded judgment works like &ldquo;tacky&rdquo; or &ldquo;cliche&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never start with a disarming phrase like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be mean, but&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not to be a jerk, but&rdquo;.  These automatically put the creator on the defensive, and undermine the positive benefit of your criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the focus on the workshop.  Don&rsquo;t get diverted into what game(s) this one is similar to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like all art, games my choose to tackle subjects that may make you uncomfortable. Don&rsquo;t attack a work for this - rather, examine why you had that reaction to the game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember too, that <em>you</em> will be the creator for an upcoming workshop.  Treat the creator as you hope they will treat you!</p>

<p>When attending a workshop remotely, good manners dictate you should have your webcam enabled and be clearly visible and not have a distracting background.  You should strive to be as much in-person as is possible remotely!</p>
