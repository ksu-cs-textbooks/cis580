    <description>Let’s go ahead and create a camera that the player can actually control. This time, we’ll adopt a camera made popular by PC first-person shooters, where the player’s looking direction is controlled by the mouse, and the WASD keys move forward and back and strife side-to-side.&#xA;The FPS Camera Class Let’s start by defining our class, FPSCamera:&#xA;/// &lt;summary&gt; /// A camera controlled by WASD + Mouse /// &lt;/summary&gt; public class FPSCamera : ICamera { }Private Fields This camera is somewhat unique in it partially the splits vertical from horizontal axes; the vertical axis only controls the angle the player is looking along, while the horizontal axis informs both looking and the direction of the player’s movement.</description>
