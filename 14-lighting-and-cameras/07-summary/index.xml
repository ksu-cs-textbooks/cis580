    <title>Summary :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/14-lighting-and-cameras/07-summary/</link>
    <description>In this lesson, we’ve seen how to apply Phong lighting using the BasicEffect, and how to set up cameras. Armed with this knowledge, you’re ready to start building explorable game environments.&#xA;A good next step is to think about what other kinds of cameras you can create. What about an over-the-shoulder camera that follows the player? Or a first-person camera that uses GamePad input? As you now know, a game camera is nothing more than code to determine where the camera is in a scene, and where it is pointed.</description>
