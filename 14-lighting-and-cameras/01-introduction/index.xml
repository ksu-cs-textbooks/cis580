    <description>Youâ€™ve now seen how vertices are grouped into triangles and rendered using accelerated hardware, how we can use a mesh of triangles to represent more complex objects, and how we can apply a texture to that mesh to provide visual detail. Now we need to add light sources that can add shading to our models, and a camera which can be shared by all objects in a scene to provide a common view and projection matrix.</description>
