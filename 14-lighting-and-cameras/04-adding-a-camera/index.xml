    <title>Adding a Camera :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/14-lighting-and-cameras/04-adding-a-camera/</link>
    <description>So far weâ€™ve set the World, View, and Transform matrix of each 3D object within that object. That works fine for these little demo projects, but once we start building a full-fledged game, we expect to look at everything in the world from the same perspective. This effectively means we want to use the same view and perspective matrices for all objects in a scene. Moreover, we want to move that perspective around in a well-defined manner.</description>
