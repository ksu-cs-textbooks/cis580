    <description>Before we delve into using the SpriteBatch, letâ€™s quickly revisit the concept of Transformations using Matrices. Our MonoGame games use 3D hardware to render 2D scenes, and the individual sprites are represented as textured quads - a polygon consisting of two triangles arranged in a rectangle. The SpriteBatch computes the coordinates of the corners of this quad from the SpriteBatch.Draw() parameters. These vectors are then transformed for the final drawing process by multiplying them by a matrix specified in the SpriteBatch.</description>
