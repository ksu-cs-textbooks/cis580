    <description>Perhaps the most common use of transforms with the sprite batch is to support screen scrolling, i.e. shifting the viewport (the visible part of the game world) around to allow for larger game worlds.&#xA;Consider what it would take to shift the game world using just what we’ve learned about sprites. We’d need to keep track of an offset for where the viewport begins relative to the world:&#xA;Then, when we draw our game objects (like sprites), we’d need to add this offset vector to the position of each as we draw them:</description>
