    <title>Summary :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/08-spritebatch-transforms/07-summary/</link>
    <description>In this chapter we explored using the transformMatrix parameter of SpriteBatch.Begin() to apply a transformation matrix to an entire batch of sprites we are rendering. This provides us with an easy mechanism for implementing a scrolling world in our games. We also looked at how we could clamp that scrolling to keep the edges of the game world on-screen.&#xA;Building upon the scrolling idea, we also examined parallax scrolling, where we create the illusion of depth by scrolling multiple layers at different speeds.</description>
