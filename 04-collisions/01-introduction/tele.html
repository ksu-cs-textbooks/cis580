<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>At the heart of every game design is interaction - interaction between the player and a simulated game world.  This simulation imposes rules about how interaction is allowed to unfold, and in nearly all cases is built upon the mechanism of collision detection - detecting when one sprite touches or overlaps another within the game world.</p>
<p>Consider the basic mechanics of many classic games:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Space Invaders</em>, bullets from the player’s turret destroy invading aliens, while alien’s bullets chew away the player’s shields and kill the player if they strike him or her.</li>
<li>In the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> series, jumping on an enemy squishes them - yet letting the enemy walk into Mario will kill him.</li>
<li>In the <em>Sonic</em> series, running over an enemy while spinning will destroy that enemy, freeing the trapped animal within, yet walking into the same enemy will hurt Sonic.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these examples, the basis for interacting with other sprites is collision detection, and, depending on the nature of the collision, different in-game effects are triggered.</p>
<p>So how do we detect collisions between two sprites? That is the subject of this chapter.</p>
