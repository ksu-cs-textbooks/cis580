    <description>At the heart of every game design is interaction - interaction between the player and a simulated game world. This simulation imposes rules about how interaction is allowed to unfold, and in nearly all cases is built upon the mechanism of collision detection - detecting when one sprite touches or overlaps another within the game world.&#xA;Consider the basic mechanics of many classic games:&#xA;In Space Invaders, bullets from the player’s turret destroy invading aliens, while alien’s bullets chew away the player’s shields and kill the player if they strike him or her.</description>
