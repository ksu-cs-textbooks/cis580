    <title>Separating Axis Theorem :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>

    <description>But what about sprites with shapes donâ€™t map to a circle or rectangle, such as this spaceship sprite:&#xA;We could represent this sprite with a bounding polygon:&#xA;The polygon can be represented as a data structure using a collection of vectors from its origin (the same origin we use in rendering the sprite) to the points defining its corners:&#xA;/// &lt;summary&gt; /// A struct representing a convex bounding polygon /// &lt;/summary&gt; public struct BoundingPolygon { /// &lt;summary&gt; /// The corners of the bounding polygon, /// in relation to its origin /// &lt;/summary&gt; public IEnumerable&lt;Vector2&gt; Corners; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// The center of the polygon in the game world /// &lt;/summary&gt; public Vector2 Center; } But can we detect collisions between arbitrary polygons?</description>
