    <title>Collision Shapes :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/04-collisions/02-collision-shapes/</link>
    <description>Perhaps the most straightforward approach is the use of a collision shape (also called a collision primitive or bounding area). This is a simplified representation of the sprite - simplified in a way that allows for easy mathematical detection of collision events. The collision shape mimics the shape of the overall sprite:&#xA;For a good visualization of collision shapes and the mathematics behind the collision detection, visit Jeffrey Thompsonâ€™s Collision Detection Page</description>
