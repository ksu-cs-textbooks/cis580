    <title>Model Basics :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/16-models/02-model-basics/</link>
    <description>A model is a collection of the information that defines a 3D object. Rather than being hand-created or hard-coded (as we have done in our previous work), a model is usually created using 3D modeling software (i.e. Blender, 3D Studio, Maya, etc). Instead of exposing the raw data of the meshes, these software packages provide an abstraction, often based on real-world sculpting techniques or constructive geometry transformations that assist artists in creating complex three-dimensional shapes.</description>
