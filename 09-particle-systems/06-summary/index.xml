    <title>Refactoring as a Game Component :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/09-particle-systems/06-summary/index.html</link>
    <description>In this chapter we examined the idea of particle systems, which draw a large number of sprites to create visual effects within the game. We also went over the design of such a system we can use with MonoGame, leveraging the DrawableGameComponent base class and design approaches like hook methods, to make a relatively hands-off but flexible approach to create new custom particle systems. We also created three example particle systems to emulate rain, explosions, and a trail of sparks.</description>
