<h1 id="game-services">Game Services</h1>

<p>A common approach in software architecture for loose coupling of systems is the use of <em>services</em>.  Services are implemented with 1) a <em>service provider</em> - essentially a collection of services that can be searched for a service, and new services can be registered with, 2) interfaces that define specific services how to work with the service, and 3) classes that implement these interfaces. This is the <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/service-locator.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Service Locator Pattern</a> as implemented in C#.</p>
<p>For a Service Provider, MonoGame provides the <a href="https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GameServiceContainer.html" rel="external" target="_blank"><code>GameServiceContainer</code></a> class, and the <code>Game</code> class has one as its <code>Service</code> property.  The default game class adds at least two services: an <code>IGraphicsDeviceService</code> and an <code>IGraphicsDeviceManager</code>.  If we need to retrieve the graphics device for some reason we could use the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">gds</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">game</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Services</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetService</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">typeof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IGraphicDeviceService</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">GraphicsDevice</span> <span class="n">gd</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">gds</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GraphicsDevice</span><span class="p">;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can add any service we want to with the <code>GameServicesContainer.AddService(Type type, object provider)</code>.  In effect, the <code>GameServicesContainer</code> acts as a dictionary for finding initialized instances of services you would use across the game.  For example, we might want to have a custom service for reporting achievements in the game.  Because the implementation would be different for the Xbox than the Playstation, we could define an interface to represent our type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">IAchievementService</span> 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="n">RegisterAchievement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Achievement</span> <span class="n">achievement</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then we could author <em>two</em> classes implementing this interface, one for the Xbox and one for the Playstation.  We would initalize and register the appropriate one for the build of our program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">game</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Services</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AddService</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IAchievementService</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">XBoxAchievementService</span><span class="p">());</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This provides us with that desirable &ldquo;loose coupling&rdquo;, where the only change we&rsquo;d need to make between the two builds is what achievement service we initialize.  A second common use for the <code>GameServicesContainer</code> is it can be passed to a constructor to provide multiple services as a single parameter, instead of having to pass each one separately.  It can also be held onto to retrieve the service at a later point in the execution, as is the case with the <code>ContentManager</code> constructor.</p>
<p>Game services are a good replacement for systems that you might otherwise use the <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/singleton.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Singleton Pattern</a> to implement.</p>
