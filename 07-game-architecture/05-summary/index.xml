    <title>Summary :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/07-game-architecture/05-summary/</link>
    <description>In this chapter we explored some new tools for organizing our game code. We learned about how MonoGame utilizes services to provide loosely-coupled access between a service provider and consumer. We also saw how the MonoGame concept of Game Components works, and how we can define custom game components and add them to the Game.Component collection. Finally, we explored one further organization tool in the Game Screen concept from the XNA GameStateManagement sample.</description>
