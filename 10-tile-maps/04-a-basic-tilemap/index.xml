    <description>Now that we have a good sense of what a tile map consists of, as well as how to effectively use a 1-dimensional array as a 2-dimensional array, let’s discuss actual implementations. As we discussed conceptually, we need: 1) a set of tiles, and 2) the arrangement of those tiles into a map.&#xA;Let’s start by thinking about our tiles. To draw a tile, we need to know:&#xA;What texture the tile appears in The bounds of the tile in that texture Where the tile should appear on screen To determine this information, we need several other items:</description>
