    <description>Letâ€™s talk briefly about how a 2d array is actually stored in memory. We like to think of it as looking something like this visualization:&#xA;But in reality, it is stored linearly, like this:&#xA;To access a particular element in the array, the 2d coordinates must be transformed into a 1d index. Note that each row follows the proceeding rows, so the starting index of each row would be the width of the row, plus the x-coordinate, i.</description>
