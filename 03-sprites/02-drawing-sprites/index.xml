    <title>Drawing Sprites :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/03-sprites/02-drawing-sprites/index.html</link>
    <description>MonoGame provides the SpriteBatch class to help mitigate the complexity of implementing textured quad sprites. It provides an abstraction around the rendering process that lets us render sprites with a minimum of fuss, with as much control as we might need.&#xA;As the name suggests, the SpriteBatch batches sprite draw requests so that they can be drawn in an optimized way. Weâ€™ll explore the different modes we can put the SpriteBatch in soon.</description>
