    <title>Summary :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/03-sprites/07-summary/index.html</link>
    <description>In this section we discussed the history of sprite implementations in video games, and saw the specific methods employed by MonoGame - textured quads rendered using the 3D hardware, and abstracted through the interface supplied by the SpriteBatch class. We saw how textures can be rendered as sprites through SpriteBatch.Draw() calls, and how those calls can be customized to position, scale, rotate, recolor, and order the sprites.&#xA;We also saw how to optimize our sprite usage with texture atlases, where multiple sprite images are placed in a single texture, and drawn by specifying a source rectangle.</description>
