    <description>The term “sprite” refers to a graphical element within a two-dimensional game that moves around the screen - often representing a character, powerup, or other actor. The term likely was coined in relation to its older definition - a small fairy creature.&#xA;Traditionally, sprites are a part of two-dimensional games, and are a raster graphic (one composed of a regular grid of pixels, aka a bitmap). As the sprites are simply an array of bits representing pixels, and the scene being presented on screen is also just an array of bits representing pixels, we can place a sprite on-screen by simply copying its bits into the right location.</description>
