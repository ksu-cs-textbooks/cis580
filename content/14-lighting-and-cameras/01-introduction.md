You've now seen how vertices are grouped into triangles and rendered using accelerated hardware, how we can use a mesh of triangles to represent more complex objects, and how we can apply a texture to that mesh to provide visual detail.  Now we need to add light sources that can add shading to our models, and a camera which can be shared by all objects in a scene to provide a common view and projection matrix.

We'll once again be working from a starter project, which provides our needed content resources.  You can clone the starter from GitHub here: [https://github.com/ksu-cis/lighting-and-cameras-starter](https://github.com/ksu-cis/lighting-and-cameras-starter)
