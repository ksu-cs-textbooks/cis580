If we want to incorporate more robust and realistic physics than that we have just explored, we would be well-served to look at _physics engines_ designed for use in games.  These are simulations built along the same lines as what we've discussed - essentially they represent the objects in the game world as rigid bodies, and provide the means for simulating them somewhat realistically.  

## Farseer / Velcro Physics
One of the best-known of the physics engines developed for XNA was the Farseer Physics Engine, which was renamed to Velcro Physics when it was moved from CodePlex to GitHub.
