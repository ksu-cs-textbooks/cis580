Much of gameplay derives from how agents in the game world (players, enemies, puzzle pieces, interactive items, etc) interact with each other.  This is the domain of _physics_, the rules of how physical (or game) objects interact.  In a sense the game physics define how the game's simulation will unfold.

While game physics often correlate to the physics of the world we inhabit _they don't have to!_  In fact, most game physics approaches at least _simplify_ real-world physics models to allow for real-time processing, and some abandon real-world physics altogether.

In this chapter we'll examine several common approaches to implementing physics in games.
