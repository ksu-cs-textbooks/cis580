In this chapter we explored some new tools for organizing our game code.  We learned about how MonoGame utilizes services to provide loosely-coupled access between a service provider and consumer.  We also saw how the MonoGame concept of Game Components works, and how we can define custom game components and add them to the `Game.Component` collection.  Finally, we explored one further organization tool in the Game Screen concept from the XNA GameStateManagement sample.  Each of these can help make larger games easier to build and maintain.
