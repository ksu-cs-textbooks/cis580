Particle systems leverage thousands of very small sprites to create the illusion of fire, smoke, explosions, precipitation, waterfalls, and many other interesting effects.  They are a staple in modern game engines both to create ambience (i.e. fires and smoke) and to enhance gameplay (glowing sparkles around objects that can be interacted with).  In this section, we'll discuss the basics of how particle engines work, and iteratively build a particle system in MonoGame that can be used in your own games.

I've prepared a starter project in which we will build this particle system.  Feel free to clone it from GithHub, here: [https://github.com/ksu-cis/particle-system-starter](https://github.com/ksu-cis/particle-system-starter)
