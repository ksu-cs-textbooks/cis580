In this chapter we looked at implementing collision detection using bounding shapes, the separating axis theorem, and per-pixel evaluation.  We discussed the merits of the different approaches, and saw how multiphase collision detection can avoid expensive collision detection tests.

There are other techniques we can use to avoid unneeded collision tests as well.  We'll talk about one of these, spatial partitioning in an upcoming chapter.
