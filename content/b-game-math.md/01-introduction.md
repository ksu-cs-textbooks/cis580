Math plays a very large role in computer games, as math is used both in the process of simulating game worlds (i.e. to calculate game physics) _and_ in the rendering of the same (i.e. to represent and rasterize 3D objects).  Algebra and trigonometry play a vital role in nearly every game's logic.  However, _vectors_, _matricies_, and _quaternions_ play an especially important role in hardware-accelerated 3D rendering.
