For many of you, workshopping represents a new kind of activity you have never engaged in. We want our workshops to be a positive learning experience, where the creator feels safe sharing their work.  Here are some guidelines to follow:

* Comments that are less than courteous and insightful have no place in a workshop.

* Don't offer empty flattery, i.e. "I loved this game."  Describe _why_ you loved it, and offer specific examples of its strengths.

* Likewise, share where the game _isn't_ working for you. Be as tactful as possible.

* All comments should be constructive, helping the creator to strengthen their game.

* You must address the game you were given, not the game _you_ would have created if it had been your idea.  _Even if you think your idea is better._

* Don't try to redesign the game for the creator.  That is for the creator to do - just point out areas of concern.

* Always start by describing the positive aspects of the game before you address any perceived weaknesses.

* Always use "I" statements.

* Avoid loaded judgment words like "tacky" or "cliche"

* Never start with a disarming phrase like "I don't want to be mean, but" or "Not to be a jerk, but".  These automatically put the creator on the defensive, and undermine the positive benefit of your criticism.

* Keep the focus on the workshop.  Don't get diverted into what game(s) this one is similar to.

* Like all art, games my choose to tackle subjects that may make you uncomfortable. Don't attack a work for this - rather, examine why you had that reaction to the game.

Remember too, that _you_ will be the creator for an upcoming workshop.  Treat the creator as you hope they will treat you!

When attending a workshop remotely, good manners dictate you should have your webcam enabled and be clearly visible and not have a distracting background.  You should strive to be as much in-person as is possible remotely!
