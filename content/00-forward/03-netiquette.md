## Workshop Etiquette
For many of you, workshopping represents a new kind of activity you have never engaged in. We want our workshops to be a positive learning experience, where the creator feels safe sharing their work.  Here are some guidelines to follow:

* Comments that are less than courteous and insightful have no place in a workshop.

* Don't offer empty flattery, i.e. "I loved this game."  Describe _why_ you loved it, and offer specific examples of its strengths.

* Likewise, share where the game _isn't_ working for you. Be as tactful as possible.

* All comments should be constructive, helping the creator to strengthen their game.

* You must address the game you were given, not the game _you_ would have created if it had been your idea.  _Even if you think your idea is better._

* Don't try to redesign the game for the creator.  That is for the creator to do - just point out areas of concern.

* Always start by describing the positive aspects of the game before you address any perceived weaknesses.

* Always use "I" statements.

* Avoid loaded judgment works like "tacky" or "cliche"

* Never start with a disarming phrase like "I don't want to be mean, but" or "Not to be a jerk, but".  These automatically put the creator on the defensive, and undermine the positive benefit of your criticism.

* Keep the focus on the workshop.  Don't get diverted into what game(s) this one is similar to.

* Like all art, games my choose to tackle subjects that may make you uncomfortable. Don't attack a work for this - rather, examine why you had that reaction to the game.

Remember too, that _you_ will be the creator for an upcoming workshop.  Treat the creator as you hope they will treat you!

When attending a workshop remotely, good manners dictate you should have your webcam enabled and be clearly visible and not have a distracting background.  You should strive to be as much in-person as is possible remotely!

## Netiquitte
Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the context and body language of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker means, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.

Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as email or Canvas:

* **Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.** Subject lines such as “Question” or “Problem” are not helpful. Subjects such as “Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java” or “Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python” give plenty of information about your topic.
* **Use only one topic per message.** If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.
* **Be thorough, concise, and to the point.** Ideally, each message should be a page or less.
* **Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.** It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you’ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.
* **Consider carefully what you write before you post it.** Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.
* **If you are lost, don’t know an answer, or don’t understand something, speak up!** Email allows you to send a message privately to the instructors. Don’t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.
* **Class discussions are confidential.** Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.
Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts. When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.
* **Do not use all caps.** It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.
* **No feigning surprise.** If someone asks a question, saying things like “I can’t believe you don’t know that!” are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.
* **No “well-actually’s."** If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a “well, actually…” correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don’t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.
* **Do not correct someone’s grammar or spelling.** Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.
* **Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.** Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.
* **Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.** They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.
