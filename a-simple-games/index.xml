      <description>As you start your game development journey, you may find yourself wondering &amp;ldquo;What kinds of games can I build, especially in only a week or two?&amp;rdquo; The answer is, lots. But if you are having trouble visualizing the possibilities, here are some examples demonstrating what is feasible in a short amount of time.</description>

      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis580/a-simple-games/03-flappy-bird/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis580/a-simple-games/03-flappy-bird/index.html</guid>
      <description>The addictive and oft-copied flappy bird game consists of few elements - a scrolling background, an animated sprite, and obstacles that scroll across the screen, creating the impression of an infinitely large world.</description>

      <title>One-Tap Quest</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis580/a-simple-games/04-one-tap-quest/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis580/a-simple-games/04-one-tap-quest/index.html</guid>
      <description>A masterful exploration of minimalist interaction, One-Tap-Quest uses a single click as the input to start the player on their path to victory or failure. The game uses static backgrounds, and a limited number of enemies and power-ups. Variety and replayability is provided entirely by random spawn locations.</description>
