      <description>As you start your game development journey, you may find yourself wondering “What kinds of games can I build, especially in only a week or two?” The answer is, lots. But if you are having trouble visualizing the possibilities, here are some examples demonstrating what is feasible in a short amount of time.</description>

      <title>Snake</title>
      <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/a-simple-games/02-snake/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/a-simple-games/02-snake/</guid>
      <description>Consider the classic game “Snake”, which has been ported to the first cellular phones, graphing calculators, and even adapted for Google Maps in this project. While very simple in implementation, it remains an enjoyable game to play.</description>

      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/a-simple-games/03-flappy-bird/</guid>
      <description>The addictive and oft-copied flappy bird game consists of few elements - a scrolling background, an animated sprite, and obstacles that scroll across the screen, creating the impression of an infinitely large world.</description>

      <title>One-Tap Quest</title>
      <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/a-simple-games/04-one-tap-quest/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:53:26 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/a-simple-games/04-one-tap-quest/</guid>
      <description>A masterful exploration of minimalist interaction, One-Tap-Quest uses a single click as the input to start the player on their path to victory or failure. The game uses static backgrounds, and a limited number of enemies and power-ups. Variety and replayability is provided entirely by random spawn locations.</description>
