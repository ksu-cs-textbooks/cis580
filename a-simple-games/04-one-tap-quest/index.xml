    <title>One-Tap Quest :: K-State CIS 580 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/a-simple-games/04-one-tap-quest/</link>
    <description>A masterful exploration of minimalist interaction, One-Tap-Quest uses a single click as the input to start the player on their path to victory or failure. The game uses static backgrounds, and a limited number of enemies and power-ups. Variety and replayability is provided entirely by random spawn locations.</description>
